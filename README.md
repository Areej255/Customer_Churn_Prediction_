# Customer_Churn_Prediction
End-to-end customer churn prediction using machine learning with a Streamlit dashboard, focusing on high-recall modeling and business-driven decision metrics.


Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Analysis

**📌 Project Overview**

Customer churn directly impacts business revenue.
This project focuses on predicting customers who are likely to churn using machine learning, with a strong emphasis on high recall to minimize missed churners.
A Streamlit dashboard is built to make predictions interpretable and actionable from a business perspective.
This is an end-to-end project covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment with Python >= 3.10.

**🎯 Business Objective**

Identify customers at high risk of churn

Prioritize recall over accuracy to avoid missing churners

Support retention campaigns while considering campaign and retention costs

Enable non-technical users to interact with model outputs via a dashboard

**🧠 Key Concepts Applied**

Churn prediction as a cost-sensitive classification problem

Precision vs Recall tradeoff

Retention cost and campaign cost awareness

Threshold-based decision making

**📊 Dataset**

Structured customer-level dataset containing behavioral, demographic, and service usage features
Target variable: Churn (Yes / No)

Data preprocessing included:
Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling

⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Model training using supervised learning algorithms

**Model evaluation using:**

Recall

Precision

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC

Threshold tuning to improve churn detection

Feature importance analysis

**Models Used**

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

The final model was selected based on business-relevant metrics, not just accuracy.

**📈 Feature Importance**

Feature importance was analyzed to:
Understand key drivers of churn

Provide interpretability for business stakeholders

Support retention strategy design

**🖥️ Streamlit Dashboard**

The Streamlit application allows users to:
Upload customer data

View churn predictions

Analyze feature importance

Explore confusion matrix and recall-focused metrics

Understand model behavior through visualizations

**💰 Business Insight**

Missing a churner (False Negative) is more costly than targeting a non-churner (False Positive)

Model decisions are aligned with campaign cost vs customer value

High recall ensures better retention coverage, even at the cost of lower precision

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Streamlit

📌 Results

Achieved high recall for churn detection
